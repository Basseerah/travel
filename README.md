# Travlla - Premium Travel & Tour Agency Template

Travlla is a high-end, responsive travel and tour agency website template designed for a premium user experience. It features modern animations, smooth carousels, and a clean, professional aesthetic.

## 🚀 Recent Improvements & Fixes

We have recently upgraded this template with several structural and visual enhancements:

- **Carousel Refactoring**: Fixed the structural issues in the "Brands Trust Us" and "Popular Search Destination" carousels. Removed redundant "cloned" HTML elements that were causing layout jumps.
- **Premium Styling**: 
    - Restored high-quality Google Fonts (`Afacad`, `Figtree`, `Kaushan Script`).
    - Enhanced Brand Logo visibility (opacity increased to 80% with smooth hover effects).
- **Responsive Fallbacks**: Implemented Flexbox-based fallback layouts for carousels to ensure the site remains functional and beautiful even if JavaScript fails.
- **Project Reorganization**: Consolidated all assets into a clean `assets/` directory (`css`, `js`, `images`) and removed redundant files for better maintainability.
